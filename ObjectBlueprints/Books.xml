"Come on, touch it." The first farmer poked at the egg nestled between fronds with his vinereaper's handle. The thin layer of ice around the ivory sphere rustled and popped before reforming quickly.

"Sultans, I already told you! No way. I ain't touching that thing, and that's the end of it. Now come on, we've got a harvest to finish." The second farmer crossed his arms, thinking himself resolute and unwavering.

The first farmer poked the egg again, disturbing the ice once more. Thin cracks ran alongside the frozen watervine, plant matter reluctantly giving way once devoid of its flexibility. He had a plan, one that would undoubtedly sway his companion's mind.

"What if I throw in a copper nugget? Maybe a few drams of water?" he tentatively offered, testing the negotiation grounds.

The second farmer's brow furrowed, his resolve melting quickly when faced with the untold possibilities of a copper nugget. Still, even touching that egg could prove unwise, especially if-

"Actually, make it two copper nuggets. I'm in a generous mood today," the first farmer added, seeing his companion pondering his first offer.

"Are you sure it's safe?" he probed the first farmer, fishing for any support he could find.

The answer came a tad too quickly: "Of course it is. Otherwise, I wouldn't be asking you to do it."

Still, two copper nuggets are two copper nuggets.
