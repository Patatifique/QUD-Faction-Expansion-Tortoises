				If you say so, lack-salt, there may be something you could help with. Have you ever came across an old saltback? Tales say, when they feel the pull of their end drawing close, they leave their kind and travel to their final resting place.

				This is what I'm after, lack-salt. The fabled Saltback Graveyard.

				Think for a second, lack-salt: scutes and bones worth ten times their weight in water, left there for the taking. Not like the deads have any use for it. Find the place – if it exists – and I'll make sure to reward you handsomely. What say you?

			<text>
				{{emote|*The Issachari sits back, visibly disappointed.*}}
				
				Just because you didn't find it does not mean it isn't there, lack-salt. Moghra'yi has a way of hiding secrets from unsavvy eyes.

				Perhaps you are telling the truth, and it is just another myth. So be it then! I have wasted enough speechwater on hunting folk tales – let my next target be flesh and blood. Go now, lack-salt.

				So be it, then. In your idiocy you confirm the place's very existence, lack-salt. Keep your eyes on your back when crossing the desert: the red-and-white is everywhere.
